## Techwise Flash Hackathon 

### Teammates: Tirth Patel, Ariel Zolton, Anthony Contreras Linarez

This project is a simple boid simulation created using Pygame. Boids are agents that simulate the flocking behavior seen in birds. The simulation includes rules for separation, alignment, and cohesion to control the movement of the boids. Additionally, obstacles can be added to the environment, affecting the boids' paths.
Features

•	Flocking Behavior: Boids follow basic rules to simulate natural flocking behavior.

•	Obstacle Avoidance: Boids avoid obstacles placed in their environment.

•	Interactive Menu: A simple start menu to begin the simulation.

•	Dynamic Background: A background image is displayed during the simulation.

Controls

•	B Key: Add a new boid at a random position within the simulation circle.

•	H Key: Add a new obstacle at a random position within the simulation circle.

•	Mouse Click: Add an obstacle at the clicked position if within the simulation circle.
